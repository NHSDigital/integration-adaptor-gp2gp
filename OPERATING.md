# Operating

How to operate the GP2GP adaptor

## Configuration

The adaptor reads its configuration from environment variables. The following sections describe the environment variables
used to configure the adaptor.

Variables without a default value and not marked optional, *MUST* be defined for the adaptor to run.

### General Configuration Options

| Environment Variable     | Default                   | Description                                                                               |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GP2GP_SERVER_PORT        | 8080                      | The port on which the GP2GP Adapter API will run.                                         |
| GP2GP_ROOT_LOGGING_LEVEL | WARN                      | The logging level applied to the entire application (including third-party dependencies). |
| GP2GP_LOGGING_LEVEL      | INFO                      | The logging level applied to GP2GP adaptor components.                                    |
| GP2GP_LOGGING_FORMAT     | (*)                       | Defines how to format log events on stdout                                                |

Logging levels are ane of: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR

The level DEBUG **MUST NOT** be used when handling live patient data.

(*) GP2GP API uses logback (http://logback.qos.ch/). The built-in [logback.xml](service/src/main/resources/logback.xml)
defines the default log format. This value can be overridden using the `GP2GP_LOGGING_FORMAT` environment variable.
You can provide an external `logback.xml` file using the `-Dlogback.configurationFile` JVM parameter.

### Database Configuration Options

The adaptor requires a Mongodb-compatible database to manage its internal state.

### MHS Adaptor and GP Connect Consumer Adaptor Client Options
Options for configuring the web client making requests to the MHS Adaptor and the GP Connect Consumer Adaptor.

Backoff options are used to perform retries of a HTTP request when the client experiences a timeout or 5xx response.
The client will perform retries up to the number provided by `MAX_BACKOFF_ATTEMPTS`.
Time to wait before making the next request attempt is calculated using the equation below, with `retryNumber` starting
at 0 for the first failure, and `jitter` being a random number in the range 0.5 - 1.5

```math
\text{timeToWait} = \text{minBackoffSeconds} \times 2.0^\text{retryNumber} \times jitter
```

Timeout is measured as total time for the HTTP request and response to complete.

## AMQP Message Broker Requirements

* The broker must be configured with a limited number of retries and dead-letter queues
* It is the responsibility of the GP supplier to configure adequate monitoring against the dead-letter queues that allows ALL undeliverable messages to be investigated fully.
* The broker must use persistent queues to avoid loss of data

**Using AmazonMQ**

* A persistent broker (not in-memory) must be used to avoid data loss.
* A configuration profile that includes settings for [retry and dead-lettering](https://activemq.apache.org/message-redelivery-and-dlq-handling.html) must be applied.
* AmazonMQ uses the scheme `amqp+ssl://` but this **MUST** be changed to `amqps://` when configuring the adaptor.

**Using Azure Service Bus**

* The ASB must use [MaxDeliveryCount and dead-lettering](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-dead-letter-queues#exceeding-maxdeliverycount)
* Azure Service Bus may require some parameters as part of the URL configuration. For example: `GP2GP_AMQP_BROKERS=amqps://<NAME>.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=<KEY NAME>;SharedAccessKey=<KEY VALUE>`

## Message Queues and Content

The adaptor subscribes to the [MHS Adaptor](https://github.com/nhsconnect/integration-adaptor-mhs)'s 
inbound queue to receive messages from Spine. Refer to the MHS Adaptor documentation to 
learn about these messages. 

TODO: Document task queue payloads

## Database Requirements

* The GP2GP adaptor must be used with Mongodb-compatible database such as Amazon Document DB or Azure Cosmos
* The adaptor stores the identifiers, status, and metadata for each patient transfer
* Deleting the mongodb database, its collections, or its records will cause any in-progress transfers to fail
* The database should be used to monitor for any failed or incomplete transfers

**Amazon Document DB Tips**

In the "Connectivity & security" tab of the cluster a URI is provided to "Connect to this cluster with an application".
Replace <username>:<insertYourPasswordHere> with the actual mongo username and password to be used by the application.
The value of `GP2GP_MONGO_URI` should be set to this value. Since the URI string contains credentials we recommend 
managing the entire value as a secured secret.

The user must have the `readWrite` role or a custom role with specific privileges.

**Azure Cosmos DB Tips**

Follow Azure documentation on Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB

## Database Design

Refer to [database.md](/documentation/database/database.md) for design details

## Detecting Failed GP2GP Transfers

The supplier must monitor the adaptor to detect failed GP2GP EHR Transfers.

`db.inventory.find({error: {$exists: true}}, {error: 1})`

Query will select the extracts where an error has occurred from the MongoDb

Detecting incomplete transfers, finds entries between the dates provided and where the process either has not reached the point of sending the acknowledgement or if it has been sent it has been sent in error: 

`db.inventory.find({created: {$gte:ISODate('2021-10-08'), $lt:ISODate('2021-10-09')}, $or:[{ackToRequester: {$exists: false}}, {"ackPending.typeCode": "AE"}]})`

## Retention of patient data

The adaptor does NOT fulfill the supplier's obligation under NPFIT-FNT-TO-IG-DES-0115.01 for
long-term data retention. The adaptor does also NOT fulfill HSCIC-PC-BLD-0068.26 requirements 
related to data retention including BR15 and S63.

The adaptor downloads and translates the patient's record in its entirety (including attachments)
before transmitting any portion of the record. The adaptor stages the translated portions in 
Object Storage (AWS S3 / Azure Blob). The supplier MUST configure a lifecycle policy
in their selected storage solution to remove these records after a reasonable time period.
The adaptor does NOT control the retention of data in object storage.

The adaptor's database records:
* the patient's NHS number
* identifiers (ODS & ASID) of the two GP practices involved in the transfer
* metadata about the transfer process

The supplier MUST configure the `GP2GP_MONGO_TTL` variable to remove the database records
after a reasonable time period.

The adaptor's queued messages contain:
* the patient's NHS number
* identifiers (ODS & ASID) of the two GP practices involved in the transfer
* metadata about the transfer process

The supplier MUST monitor the broker's dead-letter queues to investigate any errors and clear 
old messages after a reasonable time period.

## Known receiving system limits

During end-to-end testing between different GP system implementations of GP2GP we observed the following limits.

*  One implementation had a limit on the size of each individual attachment sent to it of 100MB.
   If an attachment sent to it exceeds this they will not file it into the patient record, but file a placeholder instead.
*  One implementation had a limit on the total size of all attachments sent to it, equalling 375MB (≈ 500MB encoded as base64).
   If a patient record exceeds this they will send a "Large Message general failure" response to the `IN030000UK06` message.

## Exemplar Deployment

We release adaptor image on Dockerhub as [nhsdev/nia-gp2gp-adaptor][docker-hub-image],
with the latest changes documented within the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

When performing assurance against a simulated workload involving the transfer of 100MB attachments, we
have identified a minimum of 8GB of RAM and 2 vCPUs to the container is required.

We provide [Terraform scripts][exemplar-deployment] to perform an exemplar deployment of the GP2GP adaptor and its
dependencies into AWS.
