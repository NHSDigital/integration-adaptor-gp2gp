## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

* When mapping a `Condition` without an `asserter`, omit the `Participant` element within the XML.
  Previously this would raise the error "EhrMapperException: Condition.asserter is required" and send a
  failure to the requesting system.

* When mapping a `DocumentReference` which contains a `NOPAT` `meta.security` or `NOPAT` `securityLabel` tag the resultant XML for that resource
  will contain a `NOPAT` `confidentialityCode` element.
* When mapping `AllergyIntolerances` which contain a `NOPAT` `meta.security` tag the resultant XML for that resource
  will contain a `NOPAT` `confidentialityCode` element.
* When mapping a `DiagnosticReport` or `Specimen` which contains a `NOPAT` `meta.security` tag the resultant XML for that resource
  will contain a `NOPAT` `confidentialityCode` element.
* When mapping a `TestResult`, `TestGroupHeader` or `FilingComment` which contains a `NOPAT` `meta.security` tag the resultant XML
  for that resource will contain a `NOPAT` `confidentialityCode` element.
* When mapping a `Condition` which contains a `NOPAT` `meta.security` tag the resultant XML for that resource
  will contain a `NOPAT` `confidentialityCode` element.
* When mapping a `MedicationRequest (PLAN)` which contains a `NOPAT` `meta.security` tag the resultant XML for that
  resource will contain a `NOPAT` `confidentialityCode` element.
* When mapping a `MedicationRequest (ORDER)` which contains a `NOPAT` `meta.security` tag the resultant XML for that
  resource will contain a `NOPAT` `confidentialityCode` element.
* When mapping `Immunizations` which contain a `NOPAT` `meta.security` tag, the resultant XML for that resource
  will contain a `NOPAT` `confidentialityCode` element.

## [2.1.0] - 2024-10-14

### Added

* Added functionality to automatically update the migration status to `FAILED_INCUMBENT` for any transfer where the 
  adaptor hasn't received an acknowledgement from the requesting GP surgery and the health record was sent to them more
  than 8 days ago.

### Fixed

* When mapping consultations which are "flat" (i.e., they contain a `TOPIC` without a `CATEGORY`) we now wrap the
  resource into a virtual `CATEGORY`.
  This provides compatability with a GP2GP system which would reject the transfer otherwise.
* When mapping an `Encounter` without a Recorder `participant`, now send the author as `nulFlavor=UNK`.
  Previously this would raise the error "EhrMapperException: Encounter.participant recorder is required" and send a
  failure to the requesting system.
* When mapping `ProcedureRequests` with an `occurrencePeriod` which contains only a start date, then the `text` element
  in the resultant XML will no longer contain the superfluous 'Earliest Recall Date: <startDate>' value.
* When mapping `ProcedureRequests` with a `requestor` referencing a `device` without a `manufacturer` a spurious 
  `"null"` is no longer output in the generated `"Recall Device:"` text.

## [2.0.6] - 2024-07-29

### Added

* When mapping `ReferralRequest` supporting info and `DiagnosticReports` NHS PMIP Report Numbers can also be provided 
with the code system as a URN (`urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.2.1.4.5.5`).

### Fixed
* When mapping physical quantities ("PQ") the produced XML now matches the HL7 XML specifications.

## [2.0.5] - 2024-07-04

### Fixed

* When mapping resources, if a UUID identifier is provided, this will be preserved in the produced XML.
  If a non-UUID identifier is provided, a new UUID will continue to be generated.
  This change should ensure that IDs are preserved into the new system when the record is transferred.

## [2.0.4] - 2024-06-17

### Fixed

* The GPC Consumer Adaptor JWT token is now refreshed with every request to prevent expiration issues during retries and ensure continuous, uninterrupted access; previously, we were seeing the JWT expire when a request failed and retried.

## [2.0.3] - 2024-05-20

### Fixed

- Correctly send documents which can't be fetched over GP Connect as absent attachments.
  Previously these documents wouldn't have the correct "Content Type", or "Filename" sent according to GP2GP specification.
  The adaptor also now sends the GP Connect error detail to the requesting practice to help diagnose the issue.

## [2.0.2] - 2024-04-10

### Fixed

- Updated dependencies to keep adaptor secure.

## [2.0.1] - 2024-02-22

### Fixed
- When mapping an `AllergyIntolerance` to an `ObservationStatement`, both the `availabilityTime` and `effectiveTime`
  fields were previously mapped from the `onset` field and the `assertedDate` field was ignored.
  Now, the `effectiveTime` is populated with the `onset` field, and the `availabilityTime` is populated with the
  `assertedDate` field.

## [2.0.0] - 2024-02-19

**Breaking change**: This release creates a minimum version requirement of 1.0.0 for the [GP Connect Consumer Adaptor][gpcc-adaptor].

### Fixed
- Fix GpConnectException (ASID_CHECK_FAILED_MESSAGESENDER) being thrown, a correct ASID value is fetched in GP Connect Consumer Adapter 

## [1.5.14] - 2024-01-05

### Added 
- Add configurable timeout for requests to MHS or GPCC adaptors
- Add retries with configurable backoff for 5xx or timeout from MHS or GPCC adaptors 

## [1.5.13] - 2024-01-04

### Changed
- Some data structures have been replaced with more efficient concurrent version to avoid any potential side effects
- REST client buffer limit has been increased to 150 Mb

### Fixed
- Fix logging message that incorrectly stated a conversation was closed on receipt of a negative ack referencing an
  attachment

## [1.5.12] - 2023-11-29

### Changed 
- Previously, a NOT_AUTHORISED (401) response from [`/$gpc.migratestructuredrecord`][migrate-structured-record] would generate a NACK with code 19.
  This behaviour has now been removed and instead a response type of NO_RELATIONSHIP (403) will produce NACK with code 19.

[migrate-structured-record]: https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/gpconnect-1-6-0/accessrecord_structured_development_migrate_patient_record.html

### Fixed

- Guard against possible null pointer error in exception handler.
- Fix errors within the generation of compressed EHR Extracts (happens when the record becomes >5MB) which was causing
  SystmOne to reject the transfer.

## [1.5.11] - 2023-09-26

### Fixed

- GP2GP bug - Fixed plain text file attachment being transferred into TPP as Base64Encoded. (#523)

## [1.5.10] - 2023-08-30

### Added

- Add "/requests" endpoint which returns a history of transfers made. (#500)
- Support for running the GP2GP adaptor and PS adaptors against single MHS inbound adaptor. (#494)

### Fixed

- GP2GP bug - Patient not found error was returning Response Code "6" instead of "06". (#501)
- When a GP2GP transfer fails because the MHS Adaptor rejects the attachments, we now return a Response Code of 30
  previously this situation was unhandled, and defaulted to 99. (#502)
- Mapping bug - DiagnosticReport result comments were previously generated as a NarrativeStatement with PMIP with 
  comment type `AGGREGATE COMMENT SET`, they are now generated with `USER COMMENT` (#504).
- Mapping bug - Lists which referenced [contained elements] were treated as invalid, they should now work (#507).
- GP2GP bug - Attachments with a content type not supported by Spine were being sent to the MHS Adaptor
  with their original content type. Now they are sent with `application/octect-stream` to match the GP2GP Spec. (#506)

[contained elements]: https://build.fhir.org/references.html#contained

## [1.5.7] - 2022-11-25
